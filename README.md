# PixelArt
This is my final project for the Computer Science module. I study C ++ under Qt

## Pixel Art Rendering Project
Student in Bachelor in Computer Vision, for the second semester I had to choose between two projects for a computer science class.                 Which I choose the Pixel Art Rendering.
For my project management I had to use https://www.Trello.com to organize my project and make my supervisor able to see my progress.

This project consist in 3 principles:
1. Load an image located anywher on our hard drive, display it and Save an image wherever I want.

2. Pixelized the image loaded to obtain a second image on which the pixels color is computed according to the average method.

3. Drawing pixels, this is the last part of this project I am supposed to transform the pixel into another form.
